# JS-CC-010 : Count Digits

Suppose we have an integer d between 0 and 9, we also have two positive integers low and high as lower and upper bounds, respectively. We have to find the number of times that d occurs as a digit in all integers between low and high, including the bounds low and high.

For example, d=2, low= 10, high = 23 then the output will be 6, as digit d = 2 occurs 6 times: 12, 20, 21, 22, 23.



##  Learning Outcomes
At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify and apply programming knowledge for appropriate solution.
- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by using JavaScript and Python effectively.



## Problem Statement

- Write a function that takes a 3 parameters: a digit, lower and upper bounds as integer. The function will calculate how many times the given digit occurs within the numbers including lower and upper bounds.
- Please solve the problem for  `0 <= digit < 10` and `0 < low < high`, otherwise function should return `-1`.
- If no occurrences is found in the given range, function should return `0`.
